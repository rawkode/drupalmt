This script was written to handle my own personal Drupal set-ups. It was made to be as simple and efficient.
I am aware that drush is out there and does a lot more but for me it seemed to be a bit overkill for my needs.

My Drupal set-up:
-----------------

Make a directory to contain all your git clones, I use /opt/drupal. Within this folder I have the following:

 - 7.x
   - core
     - 7.x
     - 7.10
  - modules
    - ctools
    - token
    - etc
  - themes
    - tao
    - rubik
    - etc

- 8.x
  - core
    - 8.x
  - modules
  - themes


Example Commands:
-----------------

drupal init -v 7.x -s 7.10
drupal init -v 7.x -s 7.10 -d db_name -u db_user
drupal init -v 7.x -s 7.10 -c -d db_name -u db_user
drupal enmod token
drupal dismod token
drupal entheme tao
drupal distheme tao
drupal rebuild
